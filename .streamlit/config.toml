## Configuration

The project uses a configuration file to manage server settings. Here are the available settings:

- **`enableCORS`**: Controls whether Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled. Setting this to `false` disables CORS, which might be useful for local development environments or if you are sure about your security settings.
  
- **`enableWebsocketCompression`**: Controls whether WebSocket compression is enabled. Setting this to `false` disables compression, which may be beneficial for debugging or to reduce computational overhead.

### Configuration File

Hereâ€™s an example of a configuration file (`config.toml`):

```toml
[server]
enableCORS = false
enableWebsocketCompression = false
